	<p class="style7"><em><strong>What versions are supported?:</strong></em><br> 
	The games are available for different platforms but its only been fully tested on the windows versions.<br>
	</p>
	

	<p class="style7"><em><strong>How to use it:</strong></em><br>
	<ul>
		<li class="style7">Click <i><u>Open</i></u> and browse to a game folder. Choose one of the resource files.<br>If the game is Return to Monkey Island the game will extract the decryption keys from the exe file. If it cant automatically find this file then it'll prompt you to browse and choose it.</li><br>
		<li class="style7">Click <i><u>Save File</i></u> to save a file. Different options will appear here depending on the type of file you've selected.</li><br>

		<li class="style7">Click <i><u>Save All Files</i></u> to save all files. Different options will be available here depending on the type of files available in the currently open resource file.</li><br>
	</ul>
		<p class="style7">Filtering the files:</p>

	<ul>
		<li class="style7">Click on the <i><u>View</i></u> button to show a list of all the different file types, selecting one of these changes the view so that only these file types are visible.</li><br>
		<li class="style7">To reset the view and show all files, click the button again and click <i><u>View All Files</i></u>.</li> 
	</ul>	
		<p class="style7">Searching the files:</p>
	<ul>

		<li class="style7">To search just type in the search box. Searching ignores any filter that you've used. I.e. the view will be reset to 'All Files'. The search looks in file names and is an 'instant search' - the search happens as you type.</li><br>
		<li class="style7">To reset the view either delete the text in the search box or click the View button and select View all files.</li><br>
	</ul>
